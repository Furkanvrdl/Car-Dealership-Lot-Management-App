# 🚗 Car Dealership Lot Manager (MERN Stack)

## 📝 Project Description

The **Car Dealership Lot Manager** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack. This system allows dealership staff to manage cars, track expenses, and handle administrative tasks securely. The platform includes authentication, dashboard analytics, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for vehicles and their associated expenses.

- **Frontend (React):** Handles user interface, navigation, forms, and API communication using Axios.
- **Backend (Node.js + Express):** Provides RESTful APIs for car and expense management. Includes authentication routes secured with JWT middleware.
- **Database (MongoDB):** Stores all persistent data including users, cars, and expenses.

## ⚙️ Components

### 1. Frontend (React)

The user-facing interface built with React and Bootstrap for responsive design. It includes:

- Login and Registration pages
- Dashboard with car inventory overview
- Car management and expense tracking
- Navigation bar and footer visible on every page

### 2. Backend (Node.js + Express)

The server processes requests, performs authentication, and communicates with MongoDB. Key features include:

- Secure JWT-based authentication
- CRUD endpoints for cars and expenses
- Middleware for route protection and error handling

### 3. Database (MongoDB + Mongoose)

Stores all application data in a structured and scalable way. Data models include:

- **User Model:** Manages authentication and roles
- **Car Model:** Stores details about cars in the lot
- **Sold Car Model:** Stores details about sold cars in the lot
- **Expense Model:** Tracks costs related to each car

## 🚀 Expected Challenges

During development, the biggest challenges include:

- Ensuring smooth authentication flow between frontend and backend
- Managing asynchronous data between React state and API calls
- Deploying both frontend and backend for production
